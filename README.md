# Description
This is the mighty shellmin!

It is destined to become the ultimate bash shell-based administrator for GNU & Linux distributions.

Right now, it servers as a wrapper for useful standalone scripts.

The idea is to make them standalone. Also, it should help you setup things in a fairly usable and nice way.

Did I mention that is language agnostic? As long as it is executable, you can extend! It will only require an exit status.

# How to use?
Do not; for now. It is only ready for master administrators that want to take a look at it and shout at me for a while.

# Disclaimer
Really, don't try it; don't use it. It is not tested. It is not safe. It WILL destroy your server! KEEP OUT!
