# General
- Implement OS-specific helpers.
- Implement Module-specific helpers.

# Core
## Updates
We really need to update the scripts.

## Logging
Add some really nifty loging capabilities (journalctl for now)

## Centralized configuration
Actually use the /usr/local/etc directory for something

## Setups for the controllers
implement an actual controller for the actions?

## Installation script
Yeah, I need an installation script; no sense avoiding it.

## Verification
Avoid doing things twice.

## Roll-backs
We need to implement the undo. Non-destructive configuration.

## Distributed management
Be able to manage several servers with one instance... yeah right...

## Modules/Controllers
Add more modules/controllers. Which name should I use?
